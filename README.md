<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
 <p>HTU21D,   the new <a href="http://www.isweek.com/wholesale/humidity-sensors-transmitters_1">humidity and temperature sensor</a> of MEAS is about to set new   standards in terms of size and intelligence: Embedded in a reflow   solderable Dual Flat No leads (DFN) package of 3 x 3mm foot print and   1mm height it provides calibrated, linearized signals in digital, I²C   format.<br />
</p>
<p>HTU21D   sensors are dedicated humidity and temperature plug and play   transducers for OEM applications where reliable and accurate   measurements are needed. Direct interface with a micro-controller is   made possible with the module humidity and temperature digital outputs.   HTU21D sensors are low power consumption designed for high volume and   cost sensitive applications with tight space constraints.</p>
 <p>Every   sensor is individually calibrated and tested. Lot identification is   printed on the sensor and an electronic identification code is stored on   the chip – which can be read out by command. </p>
 <p>Furthermore,   the resolution of HTU21D sensor can be changed by command (8/12bit up   to 12/14bit for RH/T), low battery can be detected and a checksum   improves communication reliability.</p>
<p>With   made improvements and the miniaturization of the sensor the   performance-to-price ratio has beenimproved – and eventually, any device   should benefit from the cutting edge energy saving operation mode.</p>
